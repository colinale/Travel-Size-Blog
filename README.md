# Tavel Blog

This project for created for those who love to travel and are looking for more opportunities to do that. We're creating this blog to give people the ability to share their experiences, how they traveled and where. Overall, this project was a challenge. We ran into a lot of issues with SQL, Javascript, and Heroku trying to get the site in. As far as our group goes, we all had crazy schedules so trying to meet up outside of class time was a big challenge for us. For that reason, communication of how to get the project done and who was doing what was also challenging. We had a fun time with the project and it was definietly fun being able to create a full stack application from scratch.

## Project Status

This project is a work in progress. Our plans for future development include reading/writing in other languages as we expand our mission. The ability to edit/delete user information, and change passwords. Offer a comment section, like/upvote. Location models to filter posts in order to offer more relevant searches. And we're also going to add areas to add information such as travel budget, modes of transportation, recommended sites to visit.
